# Cheatsheet
My practical cheatsheet for technical stuff. Often needed when helping out. <br>**Keep in mind** that this list is my personal one. Feel free to copy parts of it as well but be sure to check what it does and change it to your needs !


## Why cheatsheets?
School bored me with long textes and it didn't help my learning process. 
I found out , I prefer short, clear notes, some with memorizable mnemonic phrases! Here I would like to share my notes of topics like:

- linux
- windows
- configs / settings
- code samples
- audio stuff
- tips for productive apps

and more!
