# Notes and cheatsheet
My practical note cheatsheet for technical stuff. Often needed when helping out. <br>**Keep in mind** that this list is my personal one. Feel free to copy parts of it as well but be sure to check what it does and change it to your needs !

I found out , I prefer short, clear notes, some with memorizable mnemonic phrases! Here I would like to share my notes of topics like:

- linux
- windows
- configs / settings
- code samples
- audio stuff

and more!
