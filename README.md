# cheatsheet
A cheatsheet for technical stuff like linux, windows, websites, shortcuts, audio and more. Feel free to look around?


# Why cheatsheets?
School bored me with long textes and it didn't help my learning process. 
I prefer short, clear notes with memorizable mnemonic phrases! Here I would like to share my notes!
