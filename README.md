# cheatsheet
My practical cheatsheet for technical stuff like linux, windows, websites, shortcuts, audio and more. Often needed when helping out. Feel free to look around!


## Why cheatsheets?
School bored me with long textes and it didn't help my learning process. 
I prefer short, clear notes with memorizable mnemonic phrases! Here I would like to share my notes!
